	<h1>About Spencer Eaton</h1>

		<p>I grew up in Southington, Connecticut where I attended Southington Highschool. I then went off to attend Eastern Connecticut State University, before moving to Baltimore County MD. I live with my beautiful girlfriend and adventerous cat Binx!

	<h2>Highschool</h2>

		<p>I attended Southington Highschool from 2012 - 2016. In the first few years of highschool I played competitive soccer for the school team, the Blue Knights. I mainly played as a central foward for the team, but also filled in as an attacking winger when needed. I scored over 15 goals for the team in my first two seasons.</p>
		<p>In Southington Highschool (SHS) I took many classes. Some of my favorite subjects were sciences and history classes. The subject I hated the most was math. I absolutly hated math, I understood the necessity of needing to learn and master most maths; however, anything beyond basic algebra I felt was unessessary. I know some people make use of complex maths on a daily basis, but any thing beyond algebra was lost on me.</p>
		<p>I did fairly well in my studies in highschool. I graduated with a 3.7 GPA. Excelling in the sciences, history, and writing classes. I also enjoyed most of my non core classes, such as intro to coding, microsoft office, and other tech based classes.</p>
		<p>I have always had a love for technology and have been tech literate. When it came to apply for colleges and choosing a major I was faced with choosing between the science medical route, and the technology computer science route. I felt like I had learned more about 'non technological' sciences in school and therefore more prepaired to enter college in the medical science avenue rather than computer science. It wasent untill late in my college career, when I realized I wished I had taken computer science as my major.</p>

	<h2>Eastern Connecticut State University</h2>
		<p>I attended ECSU from 2016 - 2020. My major was Health Science. I lived on campus for all four years and met my roomate and still friend Tommy. Tommy was a computer science major. After the first year and a half of general education classes, we were able to take major specific classes. These were my favorite and I enjoyed learning about specific and complex information pertaing to your selected major. But after a year of major specific classes I had realized that even though the subject matter felt natural and came easier to me, I didnt have much of a passion for the stuff I was learning.</p>
		<p>This when I realized I should have picked a major that I was interested in like technology/computer sciences. Especially after seeing and hearing about all the cool projects and stuff my roomate Tommy was learning. Unfourtunatly I felt it was too late in my college career to switch majors. It would have added about another two years of schooling, and opted to finish out my current batchelors degree. I now whish I had just switched and got a degree in CompSci while I was there. But it is never too late for a career switch!</p>

	<h2>Present Day</h2>

		<p>In 2022 I moved to Baltimore County MD with my wonderful girlfriend who got a job down here. In the mean time I have been working at GameStop while teaching my self about Information Technlogy. I have found a real passion for IT in general and am branching out my 'feelers' for different concentrations in the field, such as cybersecurity, devops, cloud engineering, and networking administraton. I have learned alot in the past few months, and even though I do not have official schooling, I know my passion, adeptness, and willing to learn will exceed a traditional degree.</p>
