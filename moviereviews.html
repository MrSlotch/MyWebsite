		<h3>Movie Critiques Expanded!</h3>

		<h4 id="Dune:Part Two">Dune: Part Two</h4>
			<p>"Dune: Part Two" is a fantastic movie, deserving 5 out of 5 stars. As a big fan of the book, I was thrilled with how well it continued Paul Atreides' story. The cinematography is stunning, bringing the desert and futuristic technology to life beautifully. The sound design is equally impressive, with Hans Zimmer's score enhancing the epic feel of the film. From the roaring sandworms to the subtle background noises, every sound adds to the experience. The dramatic and moving scenes are profoundly impactful, with powerful performances and emotional depth that stay with you long after the credits roll. This movie captures the essence of the book perfectly and is a must-see for fans and newcomers alike.
			</p>

		<h4 id="Omen">The First Omen</h4>
			<p>"The First Omen" earns a solid 3.5 out of 5 stars. The acting performance from Nell Tiger Free is a standout, delivering a compelling and believable portrayal that keeps you engaged. The disturbing practical effect horror visuals are impressive, adding a gritty and authentic feel to the movie. The sense of tension is well-crafted, building a suspenseful atmosphere that keeps you on edge. However, as a prequel, the plot is quite predictable. Despite attempts to add twists, the story ends up feeling sloggy and unsurprising. While the film has its strengths, the lack of originality in the plot detracts from the overall experience.
